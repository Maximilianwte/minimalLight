          </p> <h2></h2><p> This Privacy
            Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used,
            and shared when you visit or make a purchase from
            lightstrategies.com. <h3>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</h3> When you visit
            the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your
            device, including information about your web browser, IP address,
            time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your
            device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information
            about the individual web pages or products that you view, what
            websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
            about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this
            automatically-collected information as “Device Information.” We
            collect Device Information using the following technologies: -
            “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer
            and often include an anonymous unique identifier.</p><p> For more
            information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
            http://www.allaboutcookies.org. - “Log files” track actions
            occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
            browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and
            date/time stamps. - “Web beacons,” “tags,” and “pixels” are
            electronic files used to record information about how you browse the
            Site. We use google analytics to track and enhance the user
            experience. All data is anonym.</p><p> In addition to that we use geoip
            from cdnservice to check if the user is located in Germany. If a
            user is located in Germany, we ask him/her if he/she wants to change
            to our german web app. We track that information only to enhance the
            user experience for the user. When we talk about “Personal
            Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about
            Device Information and Order Information. <h3>HOW DO WE USE YOUR
            PERSONAL INFORMATION?</h3> We use the Order Information that we collect
            generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including
            processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and
            providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).</p><p>
            Additionally, we use this Order Information to: Communicate with
            you; Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and When in line
            with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with
            information or advertising relating to our products or services. We
            use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
            potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
            generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
            generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact
            with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and
            advertising campaigns). <h3>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h3> We share
            your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your
            Personal Information, as described above. We also use Google
            Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site--you
