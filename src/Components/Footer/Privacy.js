            California Online Privacy Protection Act<br />
            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial
            websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law's
            reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or
            company in the United States (and conceivably the world) that
            operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information
            from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on
            its website stating exactly the information being collected and
            those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See
            more at:
            http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf
          </p>
          <p>
            According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:<br />
            Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is
            created, we will add a link to it on our home page or as a minimum,
            on the first significant page after entering our website. Our
            Privacy Policy link includes the word 'Privacy' and can easily be
            found on the page specified above.
          </p>
          <p>
            You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:<br />
            • On our Privacy Policy Page<br />

            How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?<br />
            We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or
            use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism is in
            place.

          <p>
            Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?<br />
            It's also important to note that we allow third-party behavioral

            COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)<br />
            When it comes to the collection of personal information from
            children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
            Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal
            Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection agency,
            enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites
            and online services must do to protect children's privacy and safety
            online.
          </p>
          <p>
            We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years
            old. Do we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins
            collect PII from children under 13?<br />
            Fair Information Practices<br />
            The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of
            privacy law in the United States and the concepts they include have
            played a significant role in the development of data protection laws
            around the globe. Understanding the Fair Information Practice
            Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply
            with the various privacy laws that protect personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take
            the following responsive action, should a data breach occur:<br />
            • Within 7 business days We will notify the users via in-site
            notification • Within 7 business days
          </p>
          <p>
            We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires
            that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable rights
            against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the
            law. This principle requires not only that individuals have
            enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals
            have recourse to courts or government agencies to investigate and/or
            prosecute non-compliance by data processors.
